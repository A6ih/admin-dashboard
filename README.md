# Admin Dashboard
Admin dashboard project from The Odin Project to practice and test my css grid knowledge

Live preview [here](https://a6ih.github.io/admin-dashboard/).

# Overview
I made this project as part of The Odin Project CSS Grid module, I tried to use all the tools that I have learned so far from The Odin Project, tried to replicate the design provided by from the project module as best I could.

I will try to come back to this and make it more responsive once I learn more about reponsive designs in the future lessons
